## The Problem

Fitness enthusiasts lack a simple, social way to track workouts and stay motivated long-term. Existing solutions are either too complex, too expensive upfront, or lack the community features that drive retention — users with social connections show **3x higher retention** than solo trackers.

---

## The Solution

A freemium social fitness platform with effortless activity logging and social engagement as the free hook, and locked premium features (analytics, leaderboards, goal tracking) as the conversion mechanism — all client-side with no backend required.

---

## Key Features

### Free Tier
- Activity logging with auto-calculated pace across 6 activity types (Run, Ride, Swim, Hike, Walk, Other)
- Social activity feed with kudos and comments for followed users
- Follow/unfollow system with user search

### Premium (Mock Conversion Flow)
- Strategic paywall placement on analytics, leaderboards, goals, and personal records
- Mock upgrade flow that activates premium status and updates the UI
- Exact recreation of Strava's paywall modal design
